# Signature Field Ionic Demo

This is a demo showing the [angular-signature-field directive](https://github.com/jpkraemer/angularSignatureField) in action in an Ionic app.
In our demo, the controller is implemented in `www/js/app.js`. It shows the image in a separate img tag when pressing Save, and clears the canvas when pressing Clear.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jpkraemer/angularSignatureField-Ionic-Example.git
$ bower i
```

## Run

In the browser: `ionic serve`

On a device:
```
ionic build android

```
